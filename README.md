# wrangle-osm-pittsburgh

In this project, I wrangled and analysed a ~500 MB xml file that had map data for the greater Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

Data:

https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/pittsburgh_pennsylvania/

Steps performed:

* explored data by tallying the number of certain element tags
* cleaned up data by standardizing zip and city names
* ran queries to glean insights like number of cafes per zip, and number of bridges
* brainstormed possible ideas to improve data

Technologies:
* python
* sql
* xml
* jupyter notebook
